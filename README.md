# Javscript Sign Designer

## Description

This javascript application allows a the user to use an interactive designer to create a sign for the front of their house or building.

Once they have finished their design the information is then saved in the system for someone to actually make the sign/plaque from stone and send it to the customer.

I wrote this application using Javascript and JQuery for AVC Agency who were developing a site/system for a stone mason who wanted to create signs/plaques for their customers. My task was to write the base application and they would make it look 'pretty' and attach it to the rest of the system/backend.
